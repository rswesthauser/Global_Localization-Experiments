## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this


```{r}
d4 <- fac.design(nfactors= 3, replications= 1, repeat.only= FALSE, blocks= 1, randomize= TRUE,seed= 17366, 
                 nlevels=c( 3,12,21  ), factor.names=list(VI=c("NDVI","NDRE","NDVV_RED_and_REG"), Alfa=c("0","0.1","0.2","0.3","0.4","0.4","0.5","0.6","0.7","0.8","0.9","1"), Beta=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20))); 
d4;
```


```{r}
d4[sample(size=10, replace=FALSE,1:nrow(d4)),]
```
